# Medibot-prototype-V1.0
This robot utilizes AI for home assistance and nursing automation
sections:
Biomedical sensors interface. (done)
positioning. (soon)
Face recognition. (soon)
IR vital signs AI based camera (in prototype V2.0)
Embedded CM4 with vertical stacking for more computational power. (in prototype V2)
Integrating heartrate sensor output to get blood pressure.(in prototype 2.0) (also a seperate project)
Prototype V1.0 uses a car as the main robot. While V2.0 will be a quadruped robot.
Prototype V2.0 starts shortly after V1.0 is done.
